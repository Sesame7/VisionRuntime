# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it privately by email:

- `sesame.lu@alu.uestc.edu.cn`

Anonymous reports are accepted; however, providing contact details helps us
follow up and coordinate fixes.

Please include a clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce, affected
components, and any relevant logs or proof-of-concept details.

## Response SLA

We aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Provide an initial assessment within 7 days

## Coordinated Disclosure

Please allow us reasonable time to investigate and address the issue before
public disclosure. We will coordinate with you on timelines and credit where
appropriate.

## Scope

In scope:

- Core runtime and worker pipeline
- Camera/trigger/detect/output modules
- Web HMI and Modbus interfaces
- Configuration parsing and file handling

Out of scope:
